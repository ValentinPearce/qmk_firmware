<h1 id="a-usable-default-keymap-for-the-ferris-keyboard">A usable
default keymap for the Ferris keyboard</h1>
<p>Keymaps in general are quite personal, so it is difficult to come up
with a default that will suit every user.</p>
<p>This keymap makes heavy use of keys behaving differently when tapped
and held, so that all the keys one may need remain accessible despite
the low number of thumb keys.</p>
<p>It comes with a number of layers to give access to most of the keys
one may need on a keyboard. It is not meant to be the best possible
keymap, but rather a good base on which to build a keymap that works for
you.</p>
<p>This is not the only way to make 34 keys a comfortable typing
experience, but it is one way to do so. If you don’t already know of a
better way, this may be as good a starting point as any :)</p>
<p>Note that this keymap was built from the perspective that it is OK to
take a steep learning curve if it results in a keymap that is easier to
use in the long run. This means that it may take more effort to learn
this keymap than some alternatives. “Easy to use” was assessed against
the workflow of the author, so your mileage may vary on some of the
details.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-all-these-layers-do">What do all these layers do?</h2>
<h3 id="layer-0-base-layer">Layer 0: Base layer</h3>
<figure>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/HjNHUPL.png" alt="Layer 0" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Layer 0</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>On tapping the keys, our base layer is qwerty with space on the right
homing thumb and backspace on the left homing thumb.</p>
<p>In this layer, the non-homing-thumb positions have 0 and 1. I
recommend modifying this to some frequently accessed shortcut such as
copy/paste, previous/next tab or anything that makes most sense in your
own workflow. O and 1 are place-holders and make it easy to troubleshoot
that all keys are working properly before soldering in the switches. The
reason I recommend convenience shortcuts instead of more commonly used
keys like tab or meta is that unhoming of the thumbs was a frequent
source of typos for me when I used more than one thumb key frequently in
the context of typing.</p>
<p>Despite being missing on this layer, “meta”, “tab”, “esc” and such
are accessible from any other layer: see Layer 7.</p>
<p>The behaviour of some keys differ when held: * Both homing pinkies
behave as shift. * Both bottom-row ring fingers behave as ctrl. * Both
bottom-row middle fingers behave as alt.</p>
<ul>
<li>The homing left ring finger gives access to the Function keys
layer</li>
<li>The homing right ring finger gives access to the Numbers layer</li>
<li>The homing left middle finger gives access to the Mouse layer</li>
<li>The homing right middle finger gives access to the Navigation
layer</li>
<li>The homing left index finger gives access to the Right symbols
layer</li>
<li>The homing right index finger gives access to the Left symbols
layer</li>
<li>The homing right thumb gives access to the Always accessible
layer</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="layer-1-mouse">Layer 1: Mouse</h3>
<figure>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/0fvTuB9.png" alt="Layer 1" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Layer 1</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Layer 1 is a mouse layer: it can be used one-handed or two-handed.
The most common way to use it is two handed, with left and right click
on the homerow of the left hand and directions on the homerow of the
right hand. Scrolling is available on the right hand with mid finger up
and down for vertical scroll and index and ring finger down for
horizontal scroll. On the right hand, left click and right click are
also available with index and ring finger up to allow one handed
operation. This can be particularly handy when enabling the mouse layer
permanently (no need to hold the left middle finger), which can be done
from Layer 7.</p>
<p>Note that thanks to the transparency, shift, ctrl and alt are all
accessible on the left hand while operating the mouse.</p>
<h3 id="layer-2-navigation">Layer 2: Navigation</h3>
<figure>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZquQJRq.png" alt="Layer 2" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Layer 2</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The navigation layer somewhat mirrors the mouse layer. It is accessed
by holding the right middle finger and gives access to arrow keys on the
left homerow. Page up and down, Home and End mirror the vertical
scrolling and horizontal scrolling on the mouse layer.</p>
<p>On the right hand, in addition to ctrl and alt which are available
through transparency, ctrl + alt, ctrl + alt + shift and meta are
accessible on the homerow to enable common shortcuts in some window
managers. This part is quite workflow dependent, so make sure to adapt
it to your own workflow as appropriate.</p>
<h3 id="layer-3-right-symbols">Layer 3: Right symbols</h3>
<figure>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/9tLAUqG.png" alt="Layer 3" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Layer 3</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When holding down the left index, one may access about half of the
symbols. The pinkies store <code>^</code> and <code>$</code> symbols
that represent begin and end in vim. The left homerow hosts
<code>*</code> and <code>&amp;</code>, symbols which are related in the
way that they represent some form of indirection in programming
languages such as rust. On the right hand, most symbols used when
navigating the command line are stored together, organized by columns of
related symbols.</p>
<h3 id="layer-4-left-symbols">Layer 4: Left symbols</h3>
<figure>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/CkjUSW6.png" alt="Layer 4" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Layer 4</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When holding down the right index, one may access the other symbols.
On the left hand, most of the different brackets are laid out. The most
frequent ones (round brackets and curly brackets) get a spot on the
homerow. The rest of the layer hosts the remaining symbols that are
easier to access here than on any other layers.</p>
<h3 id="layer-5-function-keys">Layer 5: Function keys</h3>
<figure>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/fWgVqc4.png" alt="Layer 5" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Layer 5</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>By holding down the left ring finger, one may access the function
keys, roughly in a numpad layout. This means that alt+F4 is easy to
type, with F4 being on the homerow. There is a shortcut for ctrl+alt on
the left hand to enable convenient switching between virtual terminals
on Linux.</p>
<h3 id="layer-6-numbers">Layer 6: Numbers</h3>
<figure>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/S8gq9Kj.png" alt="Layer 6" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Layer 6</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The number layer is accessed by holding the right ring finger. It
hosts the numbers and some duplicated symbols that are commonly accessed
next to numbers, such as mathematical operators. The number are layed
out similarly to a numpad, but with the middle row and the homerow
swapped so that the most used numbers: 0, 1, 2 and 3 are all available
in homing positions.</p>
<h3 id="layer-7-always-accessible">Layer 7: Always accessible</h3>
<figure>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/twqBeBb.png" alt="Layer 7" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Layer 7</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Layer 7 is accessed by holding the right homing thumb down. Because
this position is left transparent from every other layer, this layer is
always accessible. It gives access to some essential keys that would
typically be accessed on a thumb cluster or pinkies, such as meta,
enter, tab, esc and delete.</p>
<p>As the layer hosting esc, we duplicated some symbols here to allow
for fast navigation in vim. For instance, esc, :, w, q can be done in a
single roll.</p>
<h2 id="where-is-the-keymap.c">Where is the keymap.c?</h2>
<p>The keymap.c file is not published to the repository. It is generated
from <code>keymap.json</code> by the build system.</p>
<p>This avoids duplicating information and allow users to edit their
keymap from the qmk configurator web interface.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-edit-and-update-the-keymap">How do I edit and update
the keymap?</h2>
<p>The <code>keymap.json</code> file is generated from the qmk
configurator interface and formatted for better readability in the
context of the Ferris keyboard.</p>
<p>To edit it, you may: * Edit it directly from a text editor. * Edit it
from the qmk configurator.</p>
<p>If you decide to use the latter workflow, here are the steps to
follow:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>From the qmk configurator, hit the “import QMK keymap json file”
button (it has a drawing with an up arrow on it).</p></li>
<li><p>Browse to the location of your keymap (for example,
<code>&lt;your qmk repo&gt;/keyboards/ferris/keymaps/default/keymap.json</code>)</p></li>
<li><p>Perform any modification to the keymap in the web UI</p></li>
<li><p>Export the keymap to your downloads folder, by hitting the
“Export QMK keymap json file” button (it has a drawing with a down arrow
on it)</p></li>
<li><p>Override your original keymap with the output of formatting the
exported keymap by running a command such as this one from the root of
your qmk repo:</p>
<pre><code>./keyboards/handwired/ferris/keymaps/json2crab.py --input &lt;Your download directory&gt;/default.json &gt; ./keyboards/handwired/ferris/keymaps/default/keymap.json</code></pre>
<p>Note that you may first need to make json2crab executable by using
<code>chmod +x</code> on it. Also note that you may then want to remove
the exported keymap from your dowload directory.</p></li>
</ul>
